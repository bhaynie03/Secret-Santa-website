## Secret Santa

This website was set up by me with the help of Patricia Haynie as my graphic specialist. We were both really new to this kind of thing and it was an ambitious project. No frameworks were used and it's almost entirely done with PHP. This was a cool way to do something for the family and learn a whole lot in return.
